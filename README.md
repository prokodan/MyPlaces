#  MyPlaces
##TableView project for tracking favourite places with type and location classification.
* Project built using RealmDB model storaging;
* For rating places there were two methods imlemented: at MainViewController it's made via Cosmos framework and at NewPlaceViewController via Custom StackView;
* For map features MapKit and CoreLocation frameworks were used;
* In this project I had a practice with @IBDesignable and @IBInspectable for tracking instant changes in IB.
